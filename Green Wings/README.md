# Roomies
Web app for tracking chores for families, friends, roommates and siblings.

VISION: A simple and sleek web app that allows the user to log in, create members (roomies) and assign chores or tasks. The user will be able to track the completion of the tasks over days, weeks and months. A leaderboard will be generated, showing the roomies that have completed their tasks consistently and ranking them from 1st to 3rd Place. The app will also showcase the developers who have collaborated during the Black Wings Hackathon to make the project a reality.
